## 2025-05-18 - Feedback on Data Refresh Actions
**Learning:** Users often click "Refresh" buttons and are unsure if the action was registered or if the data simply hasn't changed.
**Action:** Always provide immediate visual feedback (loading spinner, disabled state) on "Refresh" actions, even if the backend response is expected to be fast. A success notification ("List refreshed") also confirms the action completed.
