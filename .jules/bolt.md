## 2025-02-23 - Realtime Log Parsing Optimization
**Learning:** Python's `string.strip()` and slicing create copies, which can add up in high-frequency parsing loops. Using `index`-based parsing and `find()` allows avoiding intermediate allocations. However, manual parsing in Python loops (character by character) is much slower than C-optimized string methods. The sweet spot is using C-methods like `find()` to determine indices and then slicing only the final result.
**Action:** When optimizing string parsing in Python, prefer `find()`/`index()` to locate delimiters and slice once, rather than iteratively stripping/splitting which creates garbage. Also, avoid `while` loops over string characters in Python.
